# Pain Tetris

Pain Tetris will make you feel as though you know a thing or two, before reminding you that you actually don't. Pain Tetris will sometimes make you feel trapped and mistreated. And yet somehow things go on -- blocks are eliminated and your path is clear again. Pain Tetris will help you realize that even when things don't fit perfectly, they fit surprisingly well.

And hopefully, Pain Tetris will leave you unable to play normal tetris again without becoming deathly bored.

## Description

A twist on tetris which will likely (hopefully?) cause a lot of pain and suffering.

  * Uses ClojureScript, Quil and Om
